# cost-estimation-udemy

Planning Poker  - Common Technic
People vote on the item they select - fast, collaborative(doing it as a team), you can never tell that who estimated what
we are telling the stories, they may not become true

The following three techniques are most important and total there are techniques.

#Big/Uncertain/Small
categorizing backlog items
Each of out team member(may be they can have a different color) choose from the backlog they can move it to big or uncertain or if it is small
where it
There should be a sanity check(any team member can say something if he not agree's so it has to be unanimously agreemen of small bucket, big bucket or uncertain)

team will eventually start work on unanimously agree.sectionw small bucket.


#The Bucket System - Business Value not effort.
an executive, sales team, customer service group based on relative busness value.
0(no value) -
1 (it has value) -
2 (it has better value than 1)-
3 ( it has better value than 2)-

we need to identify from backlogs and give numbers to it each depend on its value, again here also you will have sanity check, obviously if it has value decision has to be unanimmous.

#Impact/Effort
Anything that i has high impact low effort, it has to take as a highest property, it has at its best interested  and low effort as well..
If the item has no impact by high on effort its obvious we don't take it as priority.
